# jobCircular
This is a job posting app where you can submit your job circular. And other will find it here.
I am using Redux to controll the data flow. So the form submission and the fetched data are passing from redux stroe.
Action dispatcher with redux thunk is making the asynchronous api call for both post and get methods.
